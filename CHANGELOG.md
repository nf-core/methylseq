# nf-core/methylseq

## 1.5dev

### New features

* Added multicore support for `TrimGalore!`
* Improved the multicore support for Bismark methXtract for more parallelisation ([#121](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/issues/121))
* Added options `--bismark_align_cpu_per_multicore` and `--bismark_align_cpu_per_multicore` to customise how Bismark align `--multicore` is decided ([#124](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/issues/124)).

### Software updates

* _new dependency_: pigz `2.3.4`
* TrimGalore! `0.6.4` > `0.6.5`
* Bismark `0.22.2` > `0.22.3`

### Pipeline Updates

* Fixed bug where the iGenomes config was loaded after the references were set ([#121](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/issues/121))
* Removed awsbatch config profile because it is now served by [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs)

## [v1.4](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/releases/tag/1.4) - 2019-11-19

### New features

* Changed all parameter names to `snake_case`
* Added `--local_alignment` option to run Bismark with the `--local` flag to allow soft-clipping of reads.
* Added support for bismark's [SLAM-seq mode](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#slam-seq-mode)
* Added support for running bismark with HISAT2 as an aligner option [#85](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/issues/85)
* Added support for centralized configuration profiles [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs)
* Add `--meth_cutoff` parameter to change default for `bismark_methylation_extractor`
  * eg. use `--meth_cutoff 5` on the command line or `params.meth_cutoff = 5` to require 5 overlapping reads to call a methylation site.
* Added `--methyl_kit` option to run MethylDackel with the `--methylKit` flag, producing output suitable for the methylKit R package.

### Software updates

* _new dependency_: hisat2 `2.1.0`
* _new dependency_: r-markdown `1.1`
* TrimGalore! `0.5.0` > `0.6.4`
* Bismark `0.20.0` > `0.22.2`
* Bowtie2 `2.3.4.3` > `2.3.5`
* Picard `2.18.21` > `2.21.3`
* Qualimap `2.2.2b` > `2.2.2c`
* MethylDackel `0.3.0` > `0.4.0`

### Pipeline updates

* Keep memory in GB for samtools, to avoid problems with unit conversion ([#99](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/issues/99))
* Changed `params.container` for `process.container`
* Synchronised with version 1.7 of the nf-core/tools template

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug that caused conda dependencies to be resolved very slowly
* Allowed some spare memory in the samtools sort steps, avoiding crashes for some users ([#81](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/issues/81))

## [v1.3](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/releases/tag/1.3) - 2019-02-01

### New features

* Added [preseq](http://smithlabresearch.org/software/preseq/) analysis to calculate sample complexity.
  * This new step can help decide sufficient sequencing depth has been reached.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed new bug that meant pipeline only worked with one sample at a time [#66](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/issues/66)
  * Introduced in previous release. TrimGalore onwards would only process one sample.

## [v1.2](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/releases/tag/1.2) - 2019-01-02

### New features

* Trim 9bp from both ends of both reads for PBAT mode.
* Save `where_are_my_files.txt` to results directory to inform the user about missing intermediate files [#42](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/issues/42)

### Software updates

* Fastqc `0.11.7` > `0.11.8`
* Bowtie2 `2.3.4.2` > `2.3.4.3`
* Bismark `0.19.1` > `0.20.0`
* Qualimap `2.2.2a` > `2.2.2b`
* Picard `2.18.11` > `2.18.21`
* MultiQC `1.6` > `1.7`

### Bug fixes

* Fixed error when running the pipeline with `--unmapped`
  * Previously, could result in error `Error ~ No such variable: bismark_unmapped`
* Fixed error where single-sample reports could mix up log files [#48](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/issues/48)
* Fixed bug in MultiQC process that skipped results from some tools
* Supply available memory as argument to Picard MarkDuplicates

## [v1.1](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/releases/tag/1.1) - 2018-08-09

* Tests simplified - now work by simply using the `test` config profile
  * eg: `nextflow run nf-core/methylseq -profile test,docker`
  * Removed previous `run_test.sh` script and data
* New `Singularity` build script for direct compatibility with [singularity-hub](https://singularity-hub.org/)
* Minor improvements to the docs
* A number of boilerplate nf-core code updates
* Updated `process$name` nextflow syntax to avoid warnings in new versions of nextflow
* Updated software tools
  * `trim-galore` `v0.4.5` update to `0.5.0`
  * `samtools` `v1.8` update to `1.9`
  * `bowtie2` `v2.3.4.1` update to `2.3.4.2`
  * `multiqc` `v1.5` update to `1.6`
  * `picard` `v2.18.2` update to `2.18.11`
  * `bwameth` `v0.2.0` update to `0.2.2`

## [v1.0](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/releases/tag/1.0) - 2018-04-17

Version 1.0 marks the first release of this pipeline under the nf-core flag. It also marks a significant step up in the maturity of the workflow, with everything now in a single script and both aligner workflows fully supported.

* Renamed and moved [SciLifeLab/NGI-MethylSeq](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-MethylSeq/) to [nf-core/methylseq](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/)
* Merged bwa-meth and bismark pipeline scripts, now chosen with `--aligner` flag
* Refactored multi-core parameters for Bismark alignment and methylation extraction
* Rewrote most of the documentation
* Changed the Docker container to use Bioconda installations
