## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/releases/tag/2.0.0) - 2022-11-09

### Pipeline Updates

Major pipeline rewrite to use DSL2 with shared [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules).

> **Warning**: Breaking change! ⚠️

The pipeline now requires a sample sheet to be passed to the pipeline with `--input`:

| sample | fastq_1 | fastq_2 | genome |
| ------ | ------- | ------- | ------ |

See an example [here](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/blob/methylseq/samplesheet.csv)

> **Note**: The `genome` column is not yet used but will give the ability to map to multiple genomes in a single run in a future release. See [#181](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/issues/181).

Supplying the reference geneome with `--genome` as before works as usual.

### Software Updates

Major updates in commands and software versions for nearly every tool.

Please treat this new version with a little more care than usual and let us know if you find any problems!

## [v1.6.1](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/releases/tag/1.6.1) - 2021-05-08

### Pipeline Updates

- Added new config profile to run minimal test paired-end dataset, with `-profile test_paired`. Added to the CI tests.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed silent bug in Bismark alignment command that had no effect on the output ([#210](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/issues/210))

### Software updates

- Picard `2.25.1` > `2.25.4`
- MultiQC `1.10` > `1.10.1`

## [v1.6](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/releases/tag/1.6) - 2021-03-26

**:warning: Breaking change!**

In line with a standardisation change across all of nf-core, we have changed the main parameter name for supplying files to the pipeline.
In this release, please use `--input` instead of `--reads`.
The parameter still works in the same way as before.

### Pipeline Updates

- Increased resources for `fastqc` process ([#143](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/issues/143))
- Raised Nextflow version requirement to `20.07.1`
- Updated template to nf-core/tools 1.13.3
- Renamed `--reads` to `--input`
- Added new `--maxins` and `--minins` parameters to pass on to Bismark
- New `--em_seq` preset
  - Sets `bismark_maxins = 1000`, `clip_r1 = 8`, `clip_r2 = 8`, `three_prime_clip_r1 = 8`, `three_prime_clip_r2 = 8`
- New `--publish_dir_mode` parameter to customise results folder behaviour
- Fix bug on AWS for `bismark_hisat` known splice file ([#177](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/issues/177))
- Moved parameter documentation into new `nextflow_schema.json` file
  - This improves web documentation and enables `nf-core launch` functionality. See <https://nf-co.re/launch?pipeline=methylseq>
- Added a `-profile test_full` config for running the pipeline with a full-size test dataset
  - See [the config file](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/blob/dev/conf/test_full.config) for details
  - This will be used for automated release tests on AWS, results browsable on the website

- Add `--meth_cutoff` parameter to change default for `bismark_methylation_extractor`
  - eg. use `--meth_cutoff 5` on the command line or `params.meth_cutoff = 5` to require 5 overlapping reads to call a methylation site.
- Added `--methyl_kit` option to run MethylDackel with the `--methylKit` flag, producing output suitable for the methylKit R package.
