## Introduction

**nf-core/methylseq** is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used for Methylation (Bisulfite) sequencing data. It pre-processes raw data from FastQ inputs, aligns the reads and performs extensive quality-control on the results.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker / Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources.The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/methylseq/results).

## Pipeline Summary

The pipeline allows you to choose between running either [Bismark](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark) or [bwa-meth](https://github.com/brentp/bwa-meth) / [MethylDackel](https://github.com/dpryan79/methyldackel).
Choose between workflows by using `--aligner bismark` (default, uses bowtie2 for alignment), `--aligner bismark_hisat` or `--aligner bwameth`.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,genome
SRR389222_sub1,https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/raw/methylseq/testdata/SRR389222_sub1.fastq.gz,,
SRR389222_sub2,https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/raw/methylseq/testdata/SRR389222_sub2.fastq.gz,,
SRR389222_sub3,https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/raw/methylseq/testdata/SRR389222_sub3.fastq.gz,,
Ecoli_10K_methylated,https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/raw/methylseq/testdata/Ecoli_10K_methylated_R1.fastq.gz,https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/raw/methylseq/testdata/Ecoli_10K_methylated_R2.fastq.gz,
```

Each row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end).

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/methylseq --input samplesheet.csv --outdir <OUTDIR> --genome GRCh37 -profile <docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/methylseq/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/methylseq/parameters).

## Pipeline output

To see the results of an example test run with a full size dataset refer to the [results](https://nf-co.re/methylseq/results) tab on the nf-core website pipeline page.
