## Introduction

**nf-core/methylseq** is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used for Methylation (Bisulfite) sequencing data. It pre-processes raw data from FastQ inputs, aligns the reads and performs extensive quality-control on the results.

![nf-core/methylseq metro map](docs/images/4.0.0_metromap.png)

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker / Singularity / Podman / Charliecloud / Apptainer containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources.The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/methylseq/results).

## Pipeline Summary

The pipeline allows you to choose between running either [Bismark](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark), [bwa-meth](https://github.com/brentp/bwa-meth) / [MethylDackel](https://github.com/dpryan79/methyldackel) or [BWA-Mem](https://github.com/lh3/bwa) plus [rastair](https://bitbucket.org/bsblabludwig/rastair/src/master/) for for TAPS data processing. rastair can also be used with bwa-meth aligned reads by setting the aligner to `--aligner bwameth` and adding the flag `--taps`.

Choose between workflows by using `--aligner bismark` (default, uses bowtie2 for alignment), `--aligner bismark_hisat`, `--aligner bwameth` or `--aligner bwamem`. For higher performance, the pipeline can leverage the [Parabricks implementation of bwa-meth (fq2bammeth)](https://docs.nvidia.com/clara/parabricks/latest/documentation/tooldocs/man_fq2bam_meth.html) and the [Parabricks implementation of bwa-mem (fq2bammemh)](https://docs.nvidia.com/clara/parabricks/latest/documentation/tooldocs/man_fq2bam.html), which implement the baseline tools `bwa-meth` and `bwa-mem`. To use this option, include the `gpu` profile along with `--aligner bwameth` or `--aligner bwamem`.

Note: For faster CPU runs with BWA-Meth, enable the BWA-MEM2 algorithm using `--use_mem2`. The GPU pathway (Parabricks) requires `-profile gpu` and a container runtime (Docker, Singularity, or Podman); Conda/Mamba are not supported for the GPU module.

Optional targeted sequencing analysis is available via `--run_targeted_sequencing` and `--target_regions_file`; see the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/methylseq/usage) for details.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,genome
SRR389222_sub1,https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/raw/methylseq/testdata/SRR389222_sub1.fastq.gz,,
SRR389222_sub2,https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/raw/methylseq/testdata/SRR389222_sub2.fastq.gz,,
SRR389222_sub3,https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/raw/methylseq/testdata/SRR389222_sub3.fastq.gz,,
Ecoli_10K_methylated,https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/raw/methylseq/testdata/Ecoli_10K_methylated_R1.fastq.gz,https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/raw/methylseq/testdata/Ecoli_10K_methylated_R2.fastq.gz,
```

> Each row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end).

Now, you can run the pipeline using default parameters as:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/methylseq --input samplesheet.csv --outdir <OUTDIR> --genome GRCh37 -profile <docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/methylseq/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/methylseq/parameters).
